# Git for P4
This extension for Visual Studio makes it easier to use git as your day-to-day SCC system.
If you are like me and work in an industry where P4 is the standard, but like me, you think P4 is excruciating to use, hopefully this extension can help.
It will automatically remove read-only on files that you save, eliding the dialog box. This will let you maintain a normal git workflow without P4 interruptions in your day to day work.
When the time comes to submit, you can then reconcile offline work in P4, minimizing the time you have to spend with P4.
